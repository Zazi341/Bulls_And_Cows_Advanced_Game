# Bulls_And_Cows_Advanced_Game
Development of a computer-based version of the classic game "Bulls and Cows," leveraging assembly language to create a responsive, interactive application. This project was completed collaboratively and integrates advanced programming techniques with gameplay mechanics.

# Summary:  
The project focuses on implementing a user-friendly game interface with various functionalities, including:  

- **Game Mechanics:**  
  Players attempt to decode a 4-digit code by guessing and receiving feedback on correct digits and their positions (bulls and cows).  

- **Difficulty Levels:**  
  Five selectable difficulty settings, ranging from unlimited guesses to a challenging limit of 5 guesses.  

- **Randomized Code Generation:**  
  Codes are generated using non-repeating digits, randomized via system clock timing.  

- **Timer and Score Management:**  
  A built-in timer tracks the duration of gameplay, and results are saved in a text file, maintaining a record of the latest five outcomes.  

- **Control Integration:**  
  Full compatibility with both mouse and keyboard controls for seamless user interaction.  

This project demonstrates the application of advanced assembly concepts, including BIOS/DOS interrupts, stack utilization, and timing mechanisms, while overcoming challenges such as input buffer management and rendering optimizations. It is a practical and creative implementation of programming principles in a fun, interactive context.
